# Antibody affinity modeling

This repository contains examples of how to work with AI models for protein design.

* `esmfold_multimer.ipynb` demonstrates how to predict the folding of an antibody sequence 
using HuggingFace's ESMFold model.
* `antibody-affinity.ipynb` demonstrates how to load the antibody affinity dataset from
[TDCommons](https://tdcommons.ai/multi_pred_tasks/antibodyaff/) and train a 
neural network with PyTorch Lightning. (Currently the model makes very bad predictions.)
